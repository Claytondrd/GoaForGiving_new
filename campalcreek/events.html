                                <p class="ecllipseStyle">On Mother’s Day, the 13th of May, we decided to get into the creek and have kayaks and dinghies
                                    in them. CCP Commissioner Mr. Sanjit Rodrigues decided to pilot one such kayak, and there
                                    were many other citizens of Panjim and elsewhere including our Chairman Mr.
                                    <a href="../armando/index.html" target="_blank">Armando Gonsalves</a>
                                    and others, who participated in the proceedings. Our endeavour was to make people realize that the Campal Creek is a creek,
                                    and not a nullah, and that it is well on the way of getting back to its pristine best.
                                    Once the people understand that there is a paradigm shift in the thinking process of
                                    Civil Society and the Government of Goa, besides the all-important Corporation of the
                                    City of Panjim, the rest is that much an easier ride to success. And the idea of having
                                    this on Mother’s Day was apt, since it was decided that we as a responsible organization,
                                    will dedicate this to Mother Earth.</p>

                                    As much as we had fun during the cleaning process we were delighted to see some improvement
                                    in the Creek at the end of the cleanup. It brought us great happiness at the success
                                    of our first step in reviving the Creek to its beauty.</p>

                                    came together and shook a leg. Activist Artist Loretti Pinto conducted a painting workshop
                                    for kids. Bookworm organized a story telling session besides an Art and Craft time, and
                                    also had on display books by famous authors. Since it was Mother’s Day, we dedicated
                                    this day to Mother Nature and took the opportunity of unveiling the conceptual sketch
                                    of “UZO”. The Chief Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar made the honours of unveiling the sketch.
                                    He also took a boat ride into the Creek, accompanied by

                                <p class="ecllipseStyle">The main defect in the Campal Creek lies in the bridge on the D.B. Marg. The bridge has been
                                    faultily designed, due to which the flushing of water doesn't take place, thus affecting
                                    the natural cleaning of the waterbody. A new bridge has to come up and 50% of the creek
                                    issues will be solved. We requested artist Vijay Bhandare to give us a conceptual sketch
                                    for the bridge so we can put it across to the officials for their perusal. Mr. Bhandare
                                    came up with an amazing sketch which will also look beautiful once it is executed.

                                    were very delighted to be a part of this Festival as the 'Beneficiary Organisation'.
                                    Having been closely working with the kids from the St. Inez settlement, this festival
                                    gave us an opportunity to take some of the renowned authors like Kirsty Murray, Stephen
                                    McCarty, Ken Harper and Journalist Rahul Jayram to the St Inez Settlement to impart to
                                    them the importance of reading. Besides taking these writers to the settlement, we also
                                    had the privilege to mingle with Thomas Kennelly, author of Schindler’s Ark, on which
                                    the epic historical movie, Schindler’s List was based. It was an honour to have him over
                                    at our home and discuss about his next book. We also had an early 79th birthday celebration
                                    for him, when he cut 8 cakes, egging him to be in Goa for his 80th birthday next year.
                                    Partnering with the Writers & Readers Festival Goa was a great experience for us at Goa
                                    ForGiving, as we have carried a lot of memories back with us, and we look forward to
                                    the next.

                                    we had a bird walk along with Goa Birders along the Campal Creek. To our surprise, we
                                    recorded a count of 39 bird species in an hour. This goes to say that the Creek also
                                    plays an important role as a natural habitat to some of the bird species.

                                <p class="ecllipseStyle">On 15th August, 2014 Independence Day, Goa ForGiving along with The NIMR (National Institute
                                    for Malaria Research and VHSG (Voluntary Health Service Goa) organised an Environmental
                                    Health Workshop at the St. Inez Settlement. Our three organizations shared information
                                    with these “privileged” people, and the effort also included a skit that showcased the
                                    mosquito breeding problem in that region, besides also enthusing the participants in
                                    introducing “guppy” fish into the Creek so that mosquito breeding is contained by this
                                    species known for its penchant foreating up mosquito larvae.
                                    <br/> A tree planting exercise was also undertaken by our group, and this particular effort
                                    was led by enthusiastic youngsters led by the cherubic Ms Riya Shetty. The children of
                                    the St Inez Settlement also got involved, and adopted a few trees that were planted in
                                    their surroundings, and pledged to look after them in the best way they can.
                                    <br/> We also endeavoured to speak to the authorities regarding toilet facilities to be extended
                                    to the shanties since it was noticed that sewage pipelines have already been laid out
                                    there many years ago, which sadly, neither have been connected nor toilets provided,
                                    much to the chagrin of these settlers.
                                    <br/> There is a Revolution taking place in the hearts and minds of the people of Goa, and
                                    this is about participating in the saving of the Environment which has taken a severe
                                    beating due to callous attitudes of us all. It is apt that this whole process got a huge
                                    boost on Independence Day, something which made one participant comment that this is
                                    true independence, that of being free from the hitherto squalid waters of various water
                                    bodies across our beautiful land. Water is our most vital resource, and what better way
                                    to celebrate Independence Day than the commitment of a band of energetic youngsters who
                                    are heaven bent in participating in something that will benefit not only them, but the
                                    community at large?

                                    These water bodies like springs, ponds, lakes and waterfalls are facing the wrath of

                                    and we hope that our campaign will enthused Goans to do their bit to bring this issue
                                    to the focus. It was wonderful to have the support of Former Regatta Sailing Champion
                                    Mark Butt. His energy translated into a flotilla of kayaks and catamarans at the River
                                    Mandovi, making it the cynosure of all eyes on a warm working day. The boats sailed from
                                    Candolim on 22nd April morning, and landed up at the area near Inox. Whether it is the
                                    Campal Creek, or the Colva Creek, or the River Sal or any other waterway across Goa,
                                    they all are in need of serious rehabilitation if we are to ensure that our water resources
                                    are not squandered as they have been in other parts of the country.
