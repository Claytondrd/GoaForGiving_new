                                <p>She was simply ravishing in a gorgeous pink dress with heels to match as she took stage at
                                    the <a href="../gonsalvesmansion/index.html" target="_blank">Gonsalves Mansion</a> on the eve of Republic Day; when Djaima and her band started, the
                                    home of jazz was crackling as if on hot coals. 8pm on a Monday meant people drove down
                                    after a hard day at work to chill out to some exciting music; some took a break from
                                    the grapes and enjoyed beer instead as they bobbed their heads to some superb Bulgarian-Parisian
                                    Gypsy jazz. With shows like this one, the year of Music 2010 is definitely rocking at
                                    Heritage Jazz creating huge success and buzz around the state and even the country. Always
                                    known for their exceptional quality events with a wide range of musicians, styles, genres
                                    and always giving the public something novel and exciting to come to, Heritage jazz hosted
                                    some mystery, magic and of course, music as Goans flocked to Campal, for a colourful,
                                    power packed gypsy party!
                                    <br/> Djaima interestingly is a Sanskrit word which means, victory to you mother and the lady
                                    behind this stage name comes from Toutrakan, a small town by the Danube. She is a performer
                                    from the heart and creates magic when on stage, her music is strongly influenced by theatrics,
                                    dance and influences of World Music; she has performed across the globe at various events
                                    and enthralled audiences with a mystic and musical spells. In February 2009, she put
                                    her heart and soul into “Voice for Peace” where she participated with various global
                                    musicians, to create hymns and songs for peace in each country. They go beyond music
                                    and entertainment, keeping such interests at heart, creating another common ground with
                                    Heritage Jazz, which is also known for all its peace and charity associations.</p>

                                    ! On the 14th of March,
                                    the audience at jazz courtyard quenched its aural thirst with the enthralling musical
                                    cocktail of the magical EOL Trio.
                                    <br/> The trio achieved a brilliant casting with bass, drums and piano. Influenced by varied
                                    styles of music, the band was truly inspired by Led Zeppelin, Soft Machine and Herbie
                                    Hancock. The show was upbeat, electrifying and energetic with double bass yoked in Laurent
                                    David’s arms and incessant percussion by Xavier Girard. Then, there was piano and the
                                    hammond organ; liquid, instinctive, under the fingers of Denis Girard. They were simply
                                    fantastic and shared a wonderful chemistry on stage. They spoke universal language of
                                    music and charged the atmosphere with enthusiasm and life.
                                    <br/> Undoubtedly their piece was evolutionary showcasing a lot of experimentation and research.
                                    It had the power of rock and the finesse of jazz which touched every soul present for
                                    the show. The crowd dived into the edgy, electric and magical sea of sounds that emerged
                                    on the scene. Some people even felt a spiritual connection through their music.
                                    <br/> The ‘Home of Jazz’, the <a href="../gonsalvesmansion/index.html" target="_blank">Gonsalves Mansion</a> is defining the year of music in a very innovative
                                    and distinct manner. Heritage jazz has always come up with new, fresh and innovative
                                    ideas. A great interaction and involvement of the crowd could be witnessed as the band
                                    members mingled cheerily with them. They got the listeners in the mood by befriending
                                    and exchanging exciting conversations. Further they are scheduled to tour in Mumbai and
                                    Bangalore to drive the crowd of the metros into reverie.
                                    <br/> The evening was simply, charged, eclectic and on fire! The soul of every listener experienced
                                    a supernatural force leaving them stunned and yearning for more. The EOL trio was certainly
                                    power packed, just ‘parfait!’</p>

                                <h3 class="title">Indo Canadian Melange</h3>
                                <p>Februray 3rd 2010, the evening two of Canada’s top jazz artists shared centre stage with
                                    two of India’s best musicians; what happened was something truly special, classic fusion!
                                    <br/> Heritage Jazz presented Francois Bourassa, excellent Quebecois jazz pianist and Jeanne
                                    Rochette, Quebecois chanteuse par excellence, along with Sheldon D’Silva, one of India’s
                                    best bassists and Gino Banks, entertaining and talented drummer; a perfect selection
                                    of artists, each contributing pure prowess and impeccable style as they fused together.
                                    <br/> While Francois and Jeanne perform together at most of their concerts in Canada and across
                                    the globe, it was only the third time they were performing with these two talented Indian
                                    musicians. The way they supported each other on stage and the easy flow of rhythm and
                                    vocals was just perfect harmony. Jeanne was a singing classic, complete with her dramatic
                                    style and coquettish expression; she is a true ‘bete de scene’, able to mesmerise her
                                    audiences with her energy, vocal prowess, intelligence, wit and charm, all rolled into
                                    one. Francois delighted everyone on the Piano the light in his eyes bouncing of its surface
                                    as his fingers played magic and supported Jeanne’s vocals brilliantly. Sheldon was a
                                    sensation on the bass and created beautiful rhythm while Gino kept the tempo on the drums
                                    in his cool impressive style.
                                    <br/> “The people were so nice and the feeling just right” exclaimed Jeanne in her natural
                                    sweet manner while Gino said “The vibe of the place was too good, something very different.”
                                    <br/> The jazz yard filled up to the brim on a Wednesday night which truly highlighted the
                                    type of quality and world class presentation that Heritage Jazz represents. It was the
                                    last courtyard show for this season and what a way to end it. There was an electric buzz
                                    around the place and the energy was just amazing.
                                    <br/> The curtains had to close and after an encore to please the pleading audience, there
                                    were the last stums of guitar, a few piano notes and an emphatic ‘Merci Beaucoup’ from
                                    Jeanne.

                                <p>Sunday, the 3rd of January 2010, the courtyard at the home of jazz was sparking with enthusiasm,
                                    excitement and the hope that every New Year brings with it. After offering Goa a great
                                    musical buffet in 2009, Heritage Jazz was set to begin with a bang, and a bang it surely
                                    was! Each musician of this five member ensemble displayed talent, vibrancy and an electric
                                    charge. Jagdeesh M.R. led the band on the lead guitar, supported well by Prakash Sontakke
                                    on the Indian slide guitar with rich Indian classical sounds and a voice to match. While
                                    Madhuri tantalized with her deep, husky vocals, Kenneth Wilson entertained on bass guitar
                                    while Karthik Mani kept rhythm on the drums. MoonArra were joined by quirky jazz trumpeting
                                    whiz Matthias Shriefl from Germany who floored the audience with his impromptu performance.
                                    While Prakash was a strumming sensation on the slide guitar, Jagdeesh synchronized beautifully
                                    with him on the lead, producing amazing guitar magic that had the audience at the edge
                                    of their seats. Shriefl sizzled on his trumpet, picking up on the guitar fusion and translating
                                    it into some terrific trumpeting.
                                    <br/> The band was highly expressive and interactive with their audience, communicating frequently
                                    as they introduced their songs and fellow members, sprouting grand applause from the
                                    delighted listeners. Each of these musicians mixed about, enjoying friendly conversation
                                    and a few laughs with the people, during the breaks; it seemed like a get together of
                                    a bunch of friends.</p>

                                <p>The Show at <a href="../gonsalvesmansion/index.html" target="_blank">Gonsalves Mansion</a> featuring Oliver Rajamani , performing along with Steve Marcum
                                    on Drums, Joseph Santori on Bass, Suresh Buscara on Tabla and Richard Bowden on Violin
                                    was one of the best musical performances. The entire crowd - young and old- were silenced
                                    with awe and admiration while he performed ecstatically and the positive energy and vibrations
                                    from his music was incredible. There were various unique and ancient drumming art forms
                                    represented. These art forms include drums and their styles ranging from lands such as
                                    India, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. A person from the audience
                                    called it a Musical Magic show!!! saying that Oliver this guy is great with magical fingers
                                    !! The music was spiritually uniting and melodically soothing, rhythmically energizing,
                                    technically breathtaking and historically educating. Rajamani's music crosses many cultural,
                                    religious, and musical boundaries. Its spiritual essence allows people from different
                                    ethnic backgrounds and belief systems to connect to their own true spiritual identity.
                                    <br/> Rajamani created his own music by arranging traditional folk songs chronicling their
                                    historic path and by adding new compositions not found anywhere else on the globe.</p>

                                <p>Brazilian music is full of passion, of sentiment, of joy. It is the result of a long simmering

                                    proved why they are the most sought after jazz band. They were simply fabulous, as they
                                    are always.
                                    <br/> Saskia Laroo, a celebrated trumpeter combined various forms of music into a vivacious
                                    blend of hip-hop, jazz, salsa, funk reggae and world music that got people into the dancing
                                    mood. She along with Warren Byrd on the piano, William Sebastien on the beatbox, Philippe

                                <p>A cool breeze blew through the courtyard on Sunday evening, one of the best features of a
                                    classic Goan winter. The little square filled up quickly with colours, exchanged pleasantries
                                    and whispers of excitement; a perfect atmosphere with soft lights aiding the moonlight
                                    in framing the lovely gathering. The air seemed a buzz like the sparks of a crackling
                                    fire; you just got the feeling something wonderful was going to happen.Four smiling faces
                                    took the stage, hiding their high quality musical profile under a gentle coat of modesty.
                                    Sigrun, Thijs, Thomas and Georges, clad in cotton pastels, exuded a mellow charm that
                                    broke forth from their sweet smiles. When they began, drums, guitar and keyboard led
                                    by the powerful saxophone fused together forming magical melodic spells that just seemed
                                    to take our breath away. The audience was drawn in from the first swish of their musical
                                    enchantment. On stage, the fantastic four were completely at ease and seemed to communicate
                                    with each and complimented each other while giving each one space to enthrall with their
                                    respective solos. There was a mutual understanding and a fair performance by each of
                                    them, highlighting each of their talents and styles as a soloist and as a band. Sigrun
                                    simply scintillated on the saxophone, Thijs Borsten was a whiz on the keyboard, Thomas
                                    Winter Anderson entertained on the guitar and Georges du Buy kept the tempo on the drums.
                                    The Sigrun Jording Quartet delivered superior quality music and entertainment while interacting
                                    with everyone present, making it a personal and intimate experience.</p>

                                <p>Heritage Jazz events are and have always been bringing people together, sharing good times,
                                    making great music and greater memories all for the love of Goa. The past year had us
                                    thoroughly entertained with a musical buffet from Jazz for football and Jazz Nirvana
                                    to sensational Dutch musicians and our beloved Konkani Rocks; what an amazing array of
                                    concepts and shows. South Africa Calling was definitely another feather in the cap for
                                    <a href="../armando/index.html" target="_blank">Armando Gonsalves</a> and Heritage Jazz. The Marcus Wyatt quintet captured the audience with
                                    their sheer talent, style and stage presence as they performed an array of their songs.
                                    Marcus and Siya Makuzeni blended beautifully together with his saxophone and her amazing
                                    vocals. Melissa Van der Spuy was excellent on the keyboard, Prince Bulo entertained on
                                    bass while Justin Badenhorst was sensational on drums and Gavan Eckhart handled their
                                    sound very well. Marcus, highly acclaimed and talented trumpeter belongs to the breed
                                    of new generation South African musicians- respectful of the past, yet, moving forward
                                    without fear of twisting boundaries. He has performed around the globe and worked with
                                    an impressive array of musicians. This was their first time in India and they made the
                                    most of it. </p>

                                <p>After Brazil and Portugal, it was Spain that put up a cultural treat for Goans. The Gonsalves
                                    Mansion at Panaji saw traditional Spanish beats and jazz tunes enthrall guests . The
                                    show was organised by Armando Gonsalves put the show together in association with the
                                    Spanish Embassy. Percussionists Mika and Sarah wowed the crowd with their performances
                                    on an instrument called the txalaparte. They played traditional tunes from the Basque
                                    region of Spain. Later, the Joumie Vila Seseca Trio raised the tempo with their Spanish
                                    jazz. It was a relaxing and fun evening for all.</p>

                                <p>The crowd at Heritage Jazz was as eclectic as the music itself, with a vibrant range of folk,
                                    from the young ones to the young at heart; their music captured everyone’s wild side
                                    and gave us all something to talk about, laugh about, sing about or dance about. It was
                                    one crazy party with Armeet switching to beatbox spontaneously, Stu doing a mean rap
                                    track, JJ humouring us with his mosquito theatrics or Aazin singing his way into the
                                    crowd leaving them speechless. The energy level, immense spontaneity, highly innovative
                                    performances and the positive buzz about the place was just unbelievable.

                                    <br/> The band chilled with the crowd and a few beers and threw in some interesting tidbits
                                    during their performance. It truly was something spectacular, straight out of the records
                                    of Heritage Jazz high class entertainment; the band, the audience, the setting and everything
                                    surrounding the show was something different. This show screamed for superlatives in
                                    every way; the year of music sure looks like a great one. The show rocked on beyond the
                                    set time with the crowd demanding encore after encore making the band play 4 more tracks
                                    after the supposed last one; the band had to literally tell the crazy audience that it
                                    was time to hit the sack. This party at the Home of Jazz sure was something else… Something

                                    was purely Retro-Country with a little pop in between, all of which kept everyone on
                                    their toes, with even the ones seated rocking to the beat! Everyone had a lot of fun

                                    Music background. Carlton appealed to everyone, and played almost everyone's favourite
                                    oldie goldie romantic number. Most in the audience were thrilled, and tripped on the
                                    authenticity and the passion of his vocals, so much so that they stepped up to dance
                                    to his music which was punctuated by a lot of Jive, followed by the waltz.
                                    <br/> In one breadth- We want more of Carlton in the Future. He is just great. Carlton has
                                    promised that he will be back in Goa with a full fledged band that will perform contemporary
                                    jazz.
