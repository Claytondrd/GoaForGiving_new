                                <p>In 2010, Saskia was back, this time with added vigour, with South American beats to add to
                                    her already sizzling range of music. With Columbian percussions backing the band, the
                                    Saskia laroo quintet went about mesmerizing the crowds at the popular destinations Zee
                                    Bop and Utorda, and Aah Goa in Nerul.
                                    <br/> Though the crowds were not full as they normally are for her, they were sizeable enough
                                    to bring out the best in the band which has now become part of a deeper association between
                                    the Dutch and the Goan people. For all that she is doing in Goa, Saskia was nominated
                                    by us for the prestigious Karmaveer Award, and we are delighted to say that she has won
                                    the award much to everyone’s delight. Kudos to Saskia, kudos to her spirit and style.</p>

                                <p>In early December 2004, the show was graced by the Brown Indian Band which comprised of Colin
                                    D’Cruz and a host of musicians from North India as well as from South India besides having
                                    a Western Jazz segment led by Jayson Jones of Chicago . The show was an instant success
                                    and of course, Heritage Jazz was here to stay.
                                    <br/> The show featured world renowned Indian saxophone player, Padmashree Kadri Gopalnath
                                    who enthralled the audience as he toyed with the saxophone to create sounds that were
                                    absolutely incredible. He was accompanied by another genius, young Harikumar (www.hariviolin.com)
                                    of Kerala who was the recipient of the Violin Chakaravarthy at the hands of the then
                                    President of India, Mr. R.Venkataraman.
                                    <br/> Both Kadri and Hari set the quiet village of Betalbatim ablaze with sounds that had
                                    the audience spellbound. Of special note was the way Hari toyed with his violin to come
                                    up with an exciting rendition of the raga Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, moving on to an emotional
                                    Vande Mataram and since no one would allow him to leave, an absolutely exhilarating display
                                    of emotion in the rendition of our National Anthem which got the stunned audience on
                                    its feet in a spontaneous expression of reverence for our motherland. </p>

                                <h3 class="title">The Hari Stojka Quartet at Zeebop</h3>
                                <p>‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.’ All play and no work however, is a better way
                                    to go. On May 1st 2010, International Labour day, all work was left behind as men slipped
                                    into their Bermudas and ladies in their florals let down their hair and headed to Zeebop’s
                                    for an electric evening of great Gypsy music, good grub and laughter that ran into the
                                    night.
                                    <br/> Harri Stojka was electrifying on the guitar with excellent backing from his band; Claudius
                                    Jelinek on his guitar, Heimo Wiederhofer on the drums and Karl Sayer on double bass.
                                    <br/> When Harri Stojka was a kid, his dad gave him a plastic guitar he got at the fair. Only
                                    six years old, little Harri was visibly fascinated by it. So Harri's father didn't waste
                                    any time and bought him a real instrument that was appropriate for his age. From that
                                    point on, the classical or Spanish guitar became the focus of all of Harri's attention.
                                    From the very beginning, his father told him that he had to practice until his fingers
                                    smoked. One day Harri said, "Papa, I practice and practice, but I don't see any smoke!"
                                    <br/> Today he takes the same approach to the guitar and last Saturday evening, the atmosphere
                                    was surely smoking with Harri clad in a fiery hue strumming up a storm, as people sipped
                                    on pinacolada trying to cool down while even the waves rushed to the shore to catch wind
                                    of the spectacular concert in the sand.
                                    <br/> The guitars filled the evening with that gypsy charm and splendour casting a musical
                                    spell on all present.
                                    <br/> Way into the show, the audience was treated to a special surprise performance by Goa’s
                                    young talent, Varun Carvalho, who had released a great debut album ‘Gotta go Home’ comprising
                                    of honest meaningful lyrics. It was a great performance followed by much appreciation
                                    from the smiling audience. Heritage Jazz always has something unique and different to
                                    offer its audience and this show was no exception; Gypsy jazz is now etched in the minds
                                    and hearts of all the wonderful people at the show.
                                    <br/> The Harri Stojka Quartet ended with some gorgeous gypsy guitar tunes and Heritage Jazz
                                    had an exciting auction of their CD which was truly engaging and fun; some enjoyed bidding
                                    while others watched on, excitedly. The night was truly spectacular and everyone left
                                    feeling a little giddy with all that Gypsy jazz! </p>

                                <p>Since December 18 2001 was such a huge success, everyone just wanted more. And more we had
                                    in January 2003.
                                    <br /> A slightly different cast of musicians this time, but the event was wonderful with people
                                    joining in the singing and playing different instruments. These shows went on with one
                                    beautiful show in January 2003 at Valerio’s official State Bank of India residence at
                                    Altinho which lent a superb ambience to the music. This was the precursor of SBI playing

                                <p>26th December 2009, La Oasis in Anjuna still had its Christmas lights on reflecting in the
                                    blue pool while people relaxed beside it, sipping on cocktails and spicy tidbits, engrossed
                                    in interesting banter. Three young men from Paris were in Goa on their Bonjour India
                                    tour. After a beautiful performance at Alliance Francaise, Heritage Jazz invited them
                                    for an encore performance in Anjuna. Sharik, Gael and Thibault took stand below the running
                                    lights and the conversations around stopped just as they began. Sharik introduced the
                                    band to the guests and the music began to flow. These Parisian lads of diverse backgrounds
                                    and cultures met in the city of love about 2 years ago in search of a common musical
                                    vision; their talent, style and passion combined to form their novel, creative sound.
                                    Their unique compositions are the result of combining different influences such as classical,
                                    hip-hop, rock, and jazz while heavily rooted in improvisation. Blending colors and shapes
                                    with grooves and urban rhythms, this trio respects traditional styles while finding the
                                    perfect 21st century sound.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">Jazz Nirvana at Kala Academy</h3>
                                <p>JAzz Nirvana began with a scintillating solo by Amit Heri as he enchanted with his guitar.
                                    A musician worth every string he has strummed, Amit has enthralled at major international
                                    music festivals and played alongside some of the best of his contemporaries. In steps
                                    Ranjit Barot, the son of Padmashree Sitara Devi, a drumming sensation who has played
                                    at several international music festivals. He positioned himself perfectly to enable constant
                                    eye contact and communication with the band members. “Wow” was the simple yet emphatic
                                    reaction of one lady in the crowd which reflected the ambience and emotion of everyone
                                    present. Ranjit sure drummed his way into the heart of Goa. Ravi Chari joined in finally,
                                    providing a divine musical climax to this step by step performance, also adding a glorious
                                    Indian touch to it, with his sitar. The crowd loved this pure fusion of sounds and styles
                                    which captivated them completely. Just when things were at their peak, Hari Kumar stepped
                                    in with his violin for a guest performance that thrilled and had the crowd wanting more.
                                    His flexibility and amazing energy translates impeccably under the stage lights as he
                                    catures the audience and has them right where he wants them. It is no wonder that Amit
                                    is one of the best violinists in the country. Enter the sensuous and soulful ball of
                                    fire, Dutch diva Saskia Laroo and her band. Their third visit to Goa, had them perform
                                    at the successful Konkani rocks festival just 3 days prior, sending the crowd into a
                                    frenzy as the applauded them and joined in the singing of their beloved Konkani songs.
                                    Jazz Nirvana had Saskia in her element, as she wove her trumpeted magic, supported by
                                    her gifted band. Her saxophonist, Alexander Beets in one of the few tenor saxophone greats
                                    from the Netherlands. He is a well rounded musician and performs along with his brothers
                                    as well as his own quartet. His quartet is frequently asked some of the Netherlands best
                                    vocalists.

                                <p>We furter took the Jazz movement to the gardens of Panjim, and our first event was done on the 5th of November 2012. Great Swizz band, the Pommel Horse led by the bass
                                    clarinet player Lukas Roos, regaled a wonderful audience that had assembled at the Garcia
                                    de Orta Municipal Garden near the Panjim Church, and that too on a Monday evening, thus
                                    signaling the start of a grassroots movement that will enliven the musical pores of this
                                    great city.
                                    <br/> Pommel Horse consisted of 5 members who played the bass clarinet, the saxes, the keyboards,
                                    bass and drums, and provided great entertainment to an energetic audience that had gathered
                                    at the open air venue, thus bringing together the people of Panjim to enjoy a great evening
                                    of camaraderie and jazz. The Musical Revolution carries on, and Heritage Jazz once again
                                    provides that impetus to make this movement a great success!</p>

                                <p>Sharik Hasan, one of the leading pianists and composers of his generation to emerge from
                                    India was accompanied by Adam Larson on Saxophone, Philip Lemm on Drums and Raviv Markovitz
                                    on Bass. The quartet opened up the show with one of their original compositions “Onwards”,
                                    which was continued by a mixture of their originals and some standards like “Summertime”,
                                    originaly composed by George Gershwin for the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess. The quartet
                                    was on its India tour, Goa being the last destination. Sharik Hasan also gave a brief
                                    on their music school, the True School of Music which is launched in partnership with
                                    the Manhatten School of Music, NYC. Its training programmes will open up lucrative careers
                                    in music for professionals and budding musicians. The Sharik Hasan Quartet was a real
                                    treat to listen to and watch. Thunderclaps followed every piece they played. The Quartet
                                    readily extended the show by an extra piece as requested by the excited crowd who still
                                    could not get enough and yearned for more. The show was organised by Heritage Jazz as
                                    part of the “Rain or Shine Goa Rocks” series.

                                    Reiter on viola. In addition to the reeds and the viola they used their voices as a medium
                                    of expression. Juju played compositions of both band members that showed a big diversity
                                    of styles. Their program included songs with lyrics, jazz tunes and free form improvisations.

                                    great interest that the Goa Government has too, for environmental upgradation. It all
                                    starts with thought, and this is where we are today, to translate this thought into action

                                <h3 class="title">Blue Fire</h3>
                                <p>That hugely talented ensemble of musicians Blue Fire fronting as a wonderful foil for the
                                    spectacular musical feats of S Harikumar on his seven-stringed electric violin, started
                                    up the show.
                                    <br/> The music was an amazing fusion of sound of tabla, electric drums, keyboards and guitars
                                    and of course that soul stirring electric violin played to perfection by S Harikumar
                                    ’s genius. Sanjay Maroo on drums had the crowd grooving to his beat. This was the perfect
                                    start to an experimental and fun-charged evening.
                                    <br/> Fusion is just catching on and the erstwhile iron clad boundaries of pure Indian classical
                                    music are being breached slowly but surely. If anything, Harikumar’s fusion take on Raghupati
                                    Ragav Raja Ram and Vande Mataram was so singularly good that fusion music of western
                                    with classical Indian could go down smoothly as a brave new musical trend.
                                    <br/> The second part of the evening belonged to Interplay. The legendary Don Saigal joined
                                    his daughter Sonia Saigal on stage and thrilled the spectators. Adrian de Sousa was on
                                    the drums, Rishad Mistry on bass and Harmeet Manseta on keyboards. Manseta’s magic on
                                    the keyboards went over very well with the crowd. The show wound to a reluctant end way
                                    past midnight with the audience wishing Interplay would return to give them some more
                                    of their truly beautiful jazz recitals. </p>

                                <h3 class="title">Highway Village - Samba Jazz</h3>
                                <p>Samba jazz night belonged to Mandu Sarara, a five-member band led by Beto Sporleder. The
                                    music was unusual Latin jazz and samba music much to the delight of a packed audience
                                    made up of the Latin loving people of Goa, including our late Consul General of the Portuguese
                                    embassy Pedro Cabral Adao, Bebe Costa and family, Karl Vaz and family, Cecilia Menezes,
                                    Antonio Sousa, about 400 more jazz lovers. The ambience was electric, fully lit up (all
                                    ablaze in true Trancemedia style) Goa ’s Remo Fernandes chipped in with his songs and
                                    thanked the organizers for bringing a Brazilian band to Goa for the first time.
                                    <br/> The music was pure samba with ancient Brazilian tribal beats carried straight from the
                                    rural villages of Brazil , incorporated into the music of the evening. The audience had
                                    come ready to hear the usual sensuous Brazilian samba but they were astounded by the
                                    soulful throbbing beat of the ancient tribal music of Brazil . Samba icon of Goa Carlos
                                    Monteiro celebrated his birthday by performing with the band much to the delight of the
                                    Goan crowd and to the band who loved his music.
                                    <br/> Mandu Sarara means the “Blond Portuguese Men” in Toopee Guarani, a tribal language of
                                    Brazil . Lucas Vargas was amazing playing the keyboards with his left hand and the escoleta,
                                    a portable wind keyboard with his right hand. Mario Galotto sat on a stool with his feet
                                    pressing pedals that kicked brushes against small drum surfaces while his left hand rocked
                                    a tambourine and his right hand thrummed the skin in short bursts. Rodrigo Braganza played
                                    wonderfully on his acoustic guitar and on the electric guitar. Beto Sporleder made beautiful
                                    music on his transverse flutes and soprano saxophone.</p>
