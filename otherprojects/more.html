                                    But, we at GoaForgiving, celebrated “The Power of Love” in our own special way at Mother
                                    Teresa’s Home in Panjim. We chose to spend our Sunday, the 16th of February with the
                                    elderly, the sick and the orphaned, celebrating through song, dance and music, thus marking
                                    it as the Weekend of Love! People from across Goa, including all Political parties were
                                    invited to join us in spreading love, to which the AAP responded. AAP members included
                                    Dr. Oscar Rebelo, Joe Gomes, Arturo D’souza, Miki Naik and others who held a Jhadu Chalao
                                    Yatra (Sweeping Rally) from the <a href="../gonsalvesmansion/index.html" target="_blank">Gonsalves Mansion</a> up till Mother Teresa’s with the idea
                                    of sweeping our souls and working towards the betterment of our country.

                                    Miramar Circle, The <a href="../gonsalvesmansion/index.html" target="_blank">Gonsalves Mansion</a>, the old Pato Bridge and other prominent buildings
                                    in Panjim were beautifully lit up. A competition was also thrown to the general public
                                    for the best lit House, office and building.</p>

                                <p>Many don’t even know that Carnival had reached a dead end in the years 1985 to 1987 when
                                    the Pastoral Committee at the Catholic Church gave out a call for boycott of the festivities
                                    since it was not Catholic in nature. The people stayed off the celebrations as a result,
                                    with 1985 being a Carnival with lukewarm response from the people, and with a total boycott
                                    in 1986 and 1987.The unique event that was conceptualized by us many years ago and which
                                    revived the Carnival in 1988. 'People's Carnival' as we called it, was about people of
                                    different walks of life participating in small groups of friends, family and relatives.
                                    No commercial floats were allowed, and themes that were close to the heart of Goa were
                                    encouraged. Whether it was the environment, or “No to Nudism” or “No to drugs and alchohol”....the
                                    themes were reminiscent of the themes that touched Goan hearts at that time, and which
                                    continue to haunt the Goan way of life to this day.</p>

                                <p>As the idea permeated the minds of our friends, we had people from all over who decided to
                                    jump into being part of this event, with O’luv Rodriguez, the Konkani Rocks heart throb
                                    leading the way. Ann Barretto chipped in by training the Hamara School children to sing
                                    and dance for the afflicted people. The Hamara School children put in a lot of effort
                                    to bring all this together, and practiced for five continuous days in a bid to get their
                                    act together, which they did in style. With social media active to the programme, friends
                                    from Mumbai, Germany and Canada also joined us in the form of social activists Jane Rodrigues,
                                    Cynthia Fernandes and Mary Silveira. The Youth Hostel Association, Goa Unit, led by Manoj
                                    Joshi chipped in with their time and gift hampers for the kids, and they were delighted
                                    at the chance to serve our lesser fortunate brethren. The central theme of the World
                                    Cancer Day programme was that Cancer is curable, and that all of us are there to contribute
                                    whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of afflicted people. This was a chance to
                                    serve the community as well as to encourage youngsters from Hamara School to understand
                                    what it is to do things for others. Musicians, social activists and others were all present,
                                    and took the pledge that we must do more for the underprivileged sections of our society,
                                    something which the Goa ForGiving Trust is completely committed to.</p>

                                <p class="ecllipseStyle">On 15th of June 2014, Goa ForGiving along with the Botanical Society of Goa organised a Fruit
                                    and Vegetable Planting Workshop. The workshop focused on organic farming in urban areas
                                    where people have no access to ground space. Living in cities, people find it difficult
                                    to plant crops on the ground, which was why we held this workshop, to show that people
                                    who face such problems can switch to planting in pots. Kitchen Gardening is on a rise
                                    these days and more and more people are also taking it up as a hobby. Having this workshop
                                    made more sense as not many know the actual way of planting as it takes different methods
                                    to grow different types of fruits and vegetables.

                                <p>The 1st International Heritage Jazz Festival featured four major Jazz bands playing on a purpose built stage at the Heritage Jazz Village. These included Tere Estrada and band from Mexico, The Alex Stuart Quintet from Canada, K3 featuring Ranjit Sengupta and a special jazz band performing all compositions of Anthony Gonsalves.

                                        The evening of November 28, 2010 saw the International Heritage Jazz Awards Ceremony during which Anthony Gonsalves and other forgotten music heroes of Goa were honored. Anthony Gonsalves was awarded the Karmaveer Puraskar for Lifetime Achievement by the Confederation of NGOs of India (iCONGO). This was the first time that iCONGO took the award out of its home base New Delhi, keeping in mind the advanced age and frail health of Anthony Gonsalves.</p>

                                <p>World Earth Day 22 nd April was celebrated in a different way by a host of highly committed
                                    organizations which included Goa Foundation led by Dr Claude Alvares, History Heritage
                                    Action Group led by Prof Prajal Sakhardande, The Charles Correia Foundation represented
                                    by Anubhuti Chandran, Mission Green led by Architect Tallulah D’Silva, Save Goa London
                                    represented by Carmen Miranda and of course, Goa ForGiving represented by yours truly.
                                    This effort was energetically supported by the Corporation of the City of Panjim, led
                                    by their Commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues. Since the Garbage menace and the general unclean
                                    environment is a constant source of disgust in Panjim and elsewhere, we thought it wise
                                    to use this day to signify a drastic change in the way we see our city. And the response
                                    was overwhelming, with support coming in from such high profile and respected citizens
                                    mentioned above, besides scores others. The day started off at 6.30 am at the Panjim
                                    Municipal Market, with various volunteers of the “Girl Power” Group led by our very own
                                    Rhea D’Souza, the full of energy young architect who spearheaded the whole event. This
                                    group included Tania Shirodkar, Shaeen Gomes, Daisy Moreno and others, with the high
                                    point of the morning being the participation of young school kids led by Architect Tallulah
                                    D’Silva. The kids made paper bags which they distributed to the market vendors besides
                                    handing over the balance to the Panjim Mayor Surendra Furtado. The event energized the
                                    political class, and this was seen in the token presence of various elected representatives
                                    of the CCP as well as the local MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker. But the energy behind all
                                    this was undoubtedly Sanjit Rodrigues who marshalled his human resources as best as he
                                    can. From the Panjim Municipal Market, a small band of committed volunteers trooped to
                                    the Campal Beach head which is part of the Children’s Park situated there. It was a royal
                                    mess with plastic waste, paper cups, broken bottles and other garbage strewn all over
                                    the beautiful zone. It was our endeavour to clean this up as an extension of our Campal
                                    Creek Rehabilitation effort, and we were delighted to pick up scores of bags of garbage
                                    which we segregated thoroughly. We are thankful to Sachin of the CCP who kept on insisting
                                    that we segregate the garbage completely, and we managed that 100% much to the joy of
                                    all who participated in this clean up.</p>

                                <p>We took up the task of cleaning up the children's park in Divar along with the residents of the Island. Children, youth and elders got together to bring to life a place which was ignored for years. The results stark. Jan Bostok, a foreigner residing in Divar (owning a home stay in Divar) put his heart in cleaning the place. </p>

                                    beautiful Heritage zone in Goa. The clean up was led by Sergio Dias, owner of Zeebop

                                    area was to save and preserve our beautiful Heritage sites. </p>

The best part was meeting with people and connecting with them, at the same time letting them know what you do.

                                <p>Through this Music School we wish to bring to the fore the talent of underprivileged kids who we regularly work with, who have the will to learn but struggle to find the means. Goa is known for its musical background, and no better way to bring about a change in our society than through music. 
                                        The school is a tribute to Mr. Armando Gonsalves’ (founder of Goa ForGiving Trust) Rita Gonsalves’ Mother, the now late Aduzinda Gonsalves whose energy and determination saw that her talented children Rita and Armando, started upon the journey of music learning in the late 60’s when the siblings were virtual tiny tots. They did their mother proud by winning various awards including the prestigious Exhibition Award for Achievement founded by the Trinity College, they being the first to do so from Goa, with Armando being the youngest ever at that time when he was just 12 years old as he completed his 8th Grade. On the 18th, both Rita & Armando launched the School. The school is led by music teacher Anthony Fernandes along with his wife Adeline Fernandes from Pune, and is being managed by Frazer Fernandes who conducts music classes on regulary.
